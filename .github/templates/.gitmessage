#   - Separate subject line from body with a blank line
#   - Limit the subject line to 50 chars
#   - Capitalize the subject line
#   - Not end the subject line with a period
#   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   - Wrap the body at 72 chars
#   - Use the body to explain what and why instead how
